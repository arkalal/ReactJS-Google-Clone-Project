# How to use the app?

1. Open the Link of the app that is attched in the about section on the chrome browser. 

2. The Home Section of the google clone will be opened. I have made the UI/UX So pitch perfect that it will be hard for the user to differentiate between the real google page and this clone!!ðŸ˜„ðŸ”¥

# How it Works in the Background? How I have developed the Google Search System

It works based on the Google Search API and Redux State Management Functionality..

At first, I focused developing the UI/UX with Material UI(Library) and Pure Vanilla CSS(In Which I am good at ðŸ˜„ðŸ’») and tried my best to make it pitch perfect. 

After that, I have requested and API Key from the google developer console and fetched the data through the Search API. 

Then I have created a custom - googleSearch.js React Hook on my own so that I can use the data that I have fetched from the google search API into my desired React Components.

Now with the help of Redux state Management I have created a seperate independent state of data store where I can collect all the values of the inputs that a user puts in the search box. 

Finally, I have managed to connect the data store with the API so that as soon as a user puts a value in the search box the API can immediately recognize it and pull the data from the google search server as per the input value and show it in the search results.
